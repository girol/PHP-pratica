Right Triangle Checker
http://www.programmr.com/practice/phpcourse_sandbox_1971/node/2076

Write a program to allow the user to enter three integers. You must use while loop to enforce that these integers are in ascending order, though duplicate numbers are allowed. Tell the user whether or not these integers would represent the sides of a right triangle.


Note: Please use '\n' to provide line break instead of '<br/>'
Enter three integers:
Enter the 1st Number:4
Enter the 2nd Number:3
3 is smaller than 4.  Try again.
Enter the 2nd Number:-9
-9 is smaller than 4. Try again.
Enter the 2nd Number:5
Enter the 3rd Number:1
1 is smaller than 5. Try again.
Enter the 3rd Number:5
Your three sides are:
4
5
5
NO! These sides do not make a right triangle.
 

Enter three integers:
Enter the 1st Number:6
Enter the 2nd Number:8
Enter the 3rd Number:10
Your three sides are:
6
8 
10
These sides do make a right triangle.

#PHP
 echo "Enter three integers:";
