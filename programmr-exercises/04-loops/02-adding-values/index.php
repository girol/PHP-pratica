Write a program that gets several integers from the user. Sum up all the integers they give you. Stop looping when they enter a 0. Display the total at the end.

I will add up the numbers you give me.
Number-6

The total so far is 6

Number-9

The total so far is 15

Number--3

The total so far is 12

Number-2

The total so far is 14

Number-0

The total is 14

#PHP
$sum =0;
echo"I will add up the numbers you give me:";

//{ Write ur logic here
