Number guessing with a counter
http://www.programmr.com/practice/phpcourse_sandbox_1971/node/2068

Create a number guessing game ,so that they can guess until they get it right AND count the number of tries it takes them to guess it.

I have chosen a number between 1 and 10. Try to guess it:
Your guess:5
That is incorrect. Guess again:7
That is incorrect. Guess again:8
That is incorrect. Guess again:4
That is right. You are a good guesser.
It only took you 4 tries.

#PHP
$num=4;
$counter=1;
    
echo"I have chosen a number between 1 and 10. Try to guess it:";

echo"\nYour guess:";

$number = trim(fgets(STDIN)); 

// {write ur logic here








//}
