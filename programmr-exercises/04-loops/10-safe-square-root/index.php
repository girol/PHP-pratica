Safe Square Root
http://www.programmr.com/practice/phpcourse_sandbox_1971/node/2066

Write a program to take the square root of a number entered by the user. Your program should use the loop to ensure that number entered is positive, and if the number is negative you should print the error message "You can't take the square root of a negative number silly" and make them enter an input again. Reduce the squareroot upto 3 decimal places.

 

SQUARE ROOT!
Enter a number: 9
The square root of 9 is 3
 

SQUARE ROOT!
Enter a number: -9
You can't take the square root of a negative number silly
Try again: -10
You can't take the square root of a negative number silly
Try again: 10
The square root of 10 is 3.162

#PHP
echo"SQUARE ROOT!:";
echo"\nEnter a number:";
$number=trim(fgets(STDIN));
 //{write down your logic here





   
 //}
