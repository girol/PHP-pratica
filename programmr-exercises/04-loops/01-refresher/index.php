http://www.programmr.com/practice/phpcourse_sandbox_1971/node/2069

Just a short program to refresh your memory about how to program. Write a program that prompts the user for a name. Then display that name ten times. You must use a loop. If the name given is "Mitchell", display it only five times.

What is your name:gump
gump
gump
gump
gump
gump
gump
gump
gump
gump
gump
 

What is your name:Mitchell
Mitchell
Mitchell
Mitchell
Mitchell
Mitchell

#PHP
echo"What is your name:";
$a = trim(fgets(STDIN));


//{Write ur logic here
