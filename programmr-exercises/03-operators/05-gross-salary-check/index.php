In a company an employee is paid as under:
If his basic salary is less than Rs. 1500, then HRA = 10% of basic salary and DA = 90% of basic salary.
If his salary is either equal to or above Rs. 1500, then HRA = Rs. 500 and DA = 98% of basic salary.
If the employee's basic salary is input by the user write a program to find his gross salary.
Gross salary= basic salary+HRA+DA

Enter salary:2678
Total Salary-5802.44


Enter salary:2500
Total Salary-5450
