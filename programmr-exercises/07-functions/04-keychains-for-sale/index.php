Keychains for sale

Write a program that pulls up a menu with 4 options. It should look something like.

Ye Olde Keychain Shoppe:
1. Add Keychains to Order:
2. Remove Keychains from Order:
3. View Current Order:
4. Checkout:
Enter your choice-1

ADD KEYCHAINS
Enter your choice-3

VIEW ORDER
Enter your choice-2

REMOVE KEYCHAINS
Enter your choice-4

CHECKOUT
 

You will need to create functions for each of the 4 menu options. Entering the number will call the correct function.
This assignment does not require you to complete ANY of the functionality except for the working menu system. There is no need for you to program the ability to add keychains, remove keychains, view orders or checkout.
The functions should be named add_keychains(), remove_keychains(), view_order() and checkout().
Each function should print a message that it has been called.
The user should be able to keep putting in choices until the checkout() function is called. When checkout() is finished, the program should end.

#PHP
echo"Ye Olde Keychain Shoppe:";
echo"<br>1. Add Keychains to Order:";
echo"<br>2. Remove Keychains from Order:";
echo"<br>3. View Current Order:";
echo"<br>4. Checkout:";
