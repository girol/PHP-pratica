Choose a Pokemon to exchange with Butterfree(or 0 to exit)-3
Exchange Pokemon-
*Gyarados
Charmeleon Butterfree Geodude Butterfree Mankey

#PHP
    $pokemon=Array("Pikachu","Charmeleon","Geodude","Gyarados","Butterfree","Mankey");

do{
    echo "Exchange Pokemon-</br>*".$pokemon[0]."</br>";
    for($i=1;$i<=5;$i++)
    {
        echo $pokemon[$i]." ";
    }
    echo "</br>";
    echo "Choose a Pokemon to exchange with " .$pokemon[0]. "(or 0 to exit)-";
    //{Write your code here
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    //}
   

  exit;
