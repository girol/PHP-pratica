ComboString
Make a PHP program that accepts two strings as an input from the user. Display a string in the form short+long+short, with the shorter string on the outside and the longer string on the inside. If the two strings are equal, the first string will be on the outside.

Enter the 1st string:Hi
Enter the 2nd string:Hello
HiHelloHi

#PHP
   echo "Enter the 1st string:";
   $str1 = trim(fgets(STDIN));

   echo "Enter the 2nd string:";
   $str2=trim(fgets(STDIN));
     
     //{Write your code here
    
    
    
    
    
     //} 
  exit;
