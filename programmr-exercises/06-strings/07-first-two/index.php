http://www.programmr.com/practice/phpcourse_sandbox_1971/node/2128

Write a program that accepts a String from the user as an input and display first two characters of the string entered. If the String is shorter than length 2, display whatever there is and the empty string yields an empty string.

Enter a string:Hello
He

#PHP
    echo "Enter a string:";
    $mystring=trim(fgets(STDIN));
    //{Write your code here

    
    
    
    
    
    ///}
  exit;
