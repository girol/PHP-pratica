First half with second half
http://www.programmr.com/practice/phpcourse_sandbox_1971/node/2113

Write a program to swap first half with the second half of the string. In case of odd word length first half should have less no of characters. And if word length is one then no change will occur. 

Enter a string :abcde
New word is :cdeab

Enter a string :abcd
New word is :cdab

#PHP
   echo "Enter a string :";
   $str=trim(fgets(STDIN)); 
   #Write your code here {
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
    #}    
  echo "New Word is :";
  echo $result;
  exit;
