Given a string of no more than 50 characters (a character array), you need to write a function that converts character by character of the string into its binary equivalent and prints out the bits of each character.

Remember: One character consumes one byte of memory and 1 byte = 8 bits. So you need to convert one character into 8 bits of zeroes and ones.
Enter the string:Hello World
01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100000 01010111 01101111 01110010 01101100 01100100

#PHP
   echo "Enter the string:";
   $string = trim(fgets(STDIN));

     
     //{Write your code here
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
     //} 
  echo $ans;
  exit;
