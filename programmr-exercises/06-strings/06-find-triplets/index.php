Find Triplets
http://www.programmr.com/practice/phpcourse_sandbox_1971/node/2127

Make a PHP program that accepts a string as an input. Display the number of triplets in the given string. We'll say that a "triplet" in a string is a char appearing three times in a row. The triplets may overlap.

Enter a string:abcXXXabc
1
 

Enter a string:xxabyyyycd
3

#PHP
   echo "Enter a string:";
    $mystring=trim(fgets(STDIN));
    //Write your code here{







    //}
  exit;
